# Factorio Dumper
an item info/recipe tree dumper mod for factorio

This mod is intended to assist players in dumping data such as stack size, item speed, fluid amount, belt speed, and other things to spreadsheets.

It will eventually have some handy recipe requirement calculators (How much copper + iron for 300 green circuits?)
as well as an items-per-second belt calculator (how many belts of copper and iron for 1 fast belt of green circuits?)
and maybe even a train speed calculator!

To install, put the .zip file from the <a href="https://github.com/HenryFBP/factorio_dumper/releases/">releases</a> into <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods</code> as you would any other mod.
